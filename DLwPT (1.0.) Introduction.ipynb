This kind of computer falls under the category of deep learning (DL). DL deals with training mathematical entities named *deep neural networks* in the basis of examples. It leverages large amounts of data to approximate complex functions whose inputs and outputs are far apart, like an input image and as output a line of text describing the image, or a written script as input and a natural-sounding voice reciting the script as output, or detecting certain object in the image and resulted in a phrase like \"the object X is here\".\n","\n","Basic Deep Neural Networks can be shown in the figure below:\n","\n","![alt text](https://i2.wp.com/adventuresinmachinelearning.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/CNTK-Dense-example-architecture.jpg?w=413&ssl=1)\n","\n","[SOURCE](https://adventuresinmachinelearning.com/pytorch-tutorial-deep-learning/)"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"-qooisNLHFiq","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1607514365547,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":4140,"user":{"displayName":"Melia Putri Handayani","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiZim1ZfHsn20j2LHApNxRyGRR4d3KLN-gyuSl3=s64","userId":"11542230513921126930"}}},"source":["#Basic architecture of Neural Network with PyTorch\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","import torch.nn.functional as F\n","\n","#This is the \"skeleton\" of the network shown in the picture above\n","class Net(nn.Module):\n","  def __init__(self):\n","    #'super' function creates an instance of the base nn.Module class\n","    super(Net,self).__init__()\n","\n","    #The first layer fed with 28*28 pixels image inputs and connects those inputs to 200 of its nodes\n","    self.fc1=nn.Linear(28*28,200) \n","    #The second layer fed with 200 inputs from the previous layer and connects those to its 200 nodes\n","    self.fc2=nn.Linear(200,200) \n","    #The ouput layer fed with 200 inputs from the last hidden layer and connects them to its 10 nodes\n","    self.fc3=nn.Linear(200,10)\n","\n","#Now we initiate the data flow, and in this case, we use \"FORWARD METHOD\"\n","def forward(self,x):\n","  x=F.relu(self.fc1(x)) #From input to fist layer, we use ReLU activation function\n","  x=F.relu(self.fc2(x)) #From the first layer to second layer, we use ReLU activation function too\n","  x=self.fc3(x)\n","  return F.log_softmax(x) #The last one used Softmax which combined with the negative log likelihood loss function"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"fXJtVZl5KL0p","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1607514365549,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":4125,"user":{"displayName":"Melia Putri Handayani","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiZim1ZfHsn20j2LHApNxRyGRR4d3KLN-gyuSl3=s64","userId":"11542230513921126930"}},"outputId":"245b8d24-ff58-4949-e654-fd7eb403ed66"},"source":["#Confirming the structure of our network using Net()\n","net=Net()\n","print(net)"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Net(\n","  (fc1): Linear(in_features=784, out_features=200, bias=True)\n","  (fc2): Linear(in_features=200, out_features=200, bias=True)\n","  (fc3): Linear(in_features=200, out_features=10, bias=True)\n",")\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"NLGWJwfxnIBI"},"source":["### **Why PyTorch?**\n","\n","One key differentiator for deep learning libraries is immediate vs. deferred execution.
